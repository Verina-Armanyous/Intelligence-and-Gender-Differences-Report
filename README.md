**Description**
The big question that drove my interest is: Are females more intelligent than males or vice versa?
In this report, I tried to capture part of the question by exploring whether there is a difference in the average GPAs of females and males. 
I estimated the average GPA of females and males by constructing a confidence interval for both.
I also performed a test for statistical and practical significance to determine whether gender is associated with GPAs of students or not.
In other words, is there convincing evidence that gender impacts the GPA of students?

**Dataset**
I obtained this dataset from Kaggle datasets ( BoraPajo, 2016). There is a total of 73 females respondents and 48 males respondents. They were asked to give their GPA, their gender, food habits calories per day and income. In the original dataset, they had column for gender response and another for GPA, but for the sake of the study, I modified the columns to have one for female’s GPA and the other for male’s GPA to make it easier to use it for coding and calculations.
