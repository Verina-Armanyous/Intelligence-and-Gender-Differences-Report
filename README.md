The big question that drove my interest is: Are females more intelligent than males or vice versa?
In this report, I tried to capture part of the question by exploring whether there is a difference in the average GPAs of females and males. 
I estimated the average GPA of females and males by constructing a confidence interval for both.
I also performed a test for statistical and practical significance to determine whether gender is associated with GPAs of students or not.
In other words, is there convincing evidence that gender impacts the GPA of students?
